‚û°Ô∏è Startup Equity onchain DApp is a comprehensive tool designed to manage a startup or decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with features including partner management, equity management, and proposal voting. Users can add or dismiss partners, view their equity percentage, claim yields in USDT, sell their equity, and vote on proposals for adding or dismissing partners. The DApp integrates with MetaMask for secure transactions and displays real-time data on partner equity and proposal status. This project is ideal for organizations seeking a decentralized and transparent approach to managing their governance and equity distribution.

## Features

### 1) Create your own startup ‚ú®
Creating a startup has never been easier! With our DApp, anyone can quickly establish their own startup on the blockchain. This feature simplifies the initial setup process, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on their business ideas rather than technical complexities.

### 2) Manage your equity üìä
Stay on top of your investments and ownership with our detailed equity management tools. You can:

- View the number of tokens you own and understand your ownership percentage.
- Claim your yields in USDT, ensuring you receive your fair share of the profits.
- Buy or sell your equity seamlessly within the DApp, making it easy to adjust your holdings as needed.

### 3) Vote proposals üó≥Ô∏è
Participate in the governance of your startup or DAO by creating and voting on proposals. This feature empowers users to:

- Create proposals to dismiss a partner or add a new member to the DAO.
- Vote on these proposals, with the condition that if more than 50% of the total token supply votes in favor, the proposal is executed automatically.
- This ensures a democratic and fair decision-making process, enhancing the decentralized nature of the organization.
